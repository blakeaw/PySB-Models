# PySB-Models

An unofficial repository of mathematical models of biological and pharmacological systems encoded in Python using the PySB modeling framework. Visit the [PySB site](https://pysb.org/) to learn more about this modeling framework. The Goal of **PySB-Models** is to serve both as a personal (for myself) and a community resource containing a variety of models encoded using PySB.

## Submit a PySB model

You can submit a model for inclusion in this repository by opening an [Issue](https://github.com/blakeaw/PySB-Models/issues) in via the issue tracker and provide a link to the model's git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.), the model's name, and a short description (1-2 sentences).
